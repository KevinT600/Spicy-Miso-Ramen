        <p4>"This is the about page huh!"A little bit about my self is that I am 18years old, I live in Queens, NYC. Some hobbies that I have are drawing, photography, playing games of course, palying guitar, and listening to music. To be fair this is my first time ever making my own website and I expected this to be extrimely hard but I managed to pick it up really easily though this is only the beginning I hope I get to learn more about it and see how far I can truly go. As for why I chose this recipe is because I really like RAMEN especially the spicy kind though I dont know how to use chopsticks to eat it the proper way I still like eating them. And yes I also choose them because of Naruto which was a good show and one of the reasons why I am taking this course.</p4>
